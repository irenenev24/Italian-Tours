Italian Tours.
This is a website to promote three different regions in Italy. Namely Rome, Abruzzo and Sicily. Each region will have its own page where three places to vist and three things to do in the region will be highlighted. Each page will feature an interactive map that will highlight where the areas to visit are located. I want to use this website to build awareness around these areas and increase social media presence and reviews using links to social media platforms. Providing a clean and easy to navigate site with an interactive map is important to ensure good UI for new and repeat clients.
